# Memory Game in React + Typescript

This is a simple memory game with 30 cards. You can change the amount of cards in the deck by modifying the `animals` array in `/src/constants/animals.ts`.

When the game has been completed you can reset it, which results in the cards being shuffled.

The icons are using the [Icones - Noto Emojis](https://icones.js.org/collection/noto?category=Animals+%26+Nature) icon pack for the animal figures.

## Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# start local server
npm run dev
```
